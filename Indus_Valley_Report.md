# Welcome to the Indus Valley Annual Report 2025

India’s vibrant startup ecosystem, concentrated in the eastern suburbs of Bangalore, the satellite cities of Gurgaon and Noida in the Delhi National Capital Region (NCR), the districts of Lower Parel & the Andheri East – Powai belt in Mumbai, the Southern suburbs of Chennai, and in the various scattered pockets across many other cities such as Pune, Hyderabad, Chandigarh etc., has lacked a singular name.

At Blume, we like to use Indus Valley as a catch all moniker for the Indian startup ecosystem. It is a twist on the typical Silicon Wadi / Glen / Fen naming convention, as well as a reference to the Indus Valley Civilisation, one of the vibrant centres of the ancient world, and the ancestral civilisation of the Indian people.

Unlike Silicon Valley which has a geographical connotation, the term Indus Valley has no such overtone. It is instead a reference to the entire Indian startup ecosystem, spread throughout the nation. It is also an attitude, a mindset, one of invention, and ‘jugaad’ and chutzpah.

The **Indus Valley Annual Report** published by Blume Ventures, celebrates the rise of Indus Valley, and its emergence as one of the centres of innovation and enterprise in the startup world. It gives us a chance to look back, and take stock of its evolution, and look ahead to what is coming. We welcome you to the fourth edition of the Indus Valley Annual Report! Our previous editions (2024, 2023, 2022) can be accessed at the website indusvalleyreport.com

# How to read this report

Given we have sourced the data across various reports and datasets, consistency in data will always be a challenge. That said, while sometimes an occasional number or two may not match with the other, the broad direction or narrative of these is consistent and comparable.

We have used millions, billions, trillions (vs lacs, crores) where possible. When we use ₹ billion or ₹ trillion, it can sometimes be hard to translate it to $. A shorthand for ₹ billion to $ million is that ₹1 billion = $120 million roughly. A shorthand for ₹ trillion to $ billion is ₹1 trillion = $12 billion roughly.

Despite all the charts and datasets we have listed, this is not a data book. We didn’t create it to serve as an exhaustive repository of data or reportage on India. Rather, it is more a narrative, and less a dataguide. Or even better, you should see it as a source of perspective on the Indian startup ecosystem. And as with all perspectives, a lot depends on the vantage point of the observer. As the leading seed fund in India, we do think we have a unique perspective and insight into the Indian startup ecosystem, or Indus Valley, as we term it. And with The Indus Valley Report, we hope to get you, dear reader, to view the Indian economy through our lens. Do tell us how you see it. Compliments, criticism, feedback all welcome at sp@blume.vc and / or anurag@blume.vc

# India in one tweet

AI meets caste. Cutting-edge tech-advances in AI collide with that most ancient of Indian institutions, the caste system.

[Redacted]

The associations in this tweet expose a clear bias. Many of these would be considered inappropriate in contemporary Indian discourse.

Yet, the AI completion offers a clear glimpse at how India’s deeply rooted social structures continue to shape perspectives, even when filtered through modern technologies and global pop culture touchpoints.

**India - The Last 5 Years**

How we got here; a look at the events, trends, policies, and initiatives that shaped the Indian economy over the past five years through COVID, and after. We cover the economic downturn, government initiatives to spur recovery, subsequent boom, and inflationary growth, followed by RBI initiatives to control inflation, and finally the growth taper as consumption and government spends reduced.

## The cost of recovery: soaring fiscal deficit, and rising inflation

The revival of the Indian economy was achieved through aggressive government spending, which doubled the fiscal deficit between FY20 and FY21, eventually resulting in a rise in money supply. The combination of expanded money supply, along with surging personal credit, and resurgent consumption pushed inflation steadily upward.

# India

## Long-Term Structural Forces

### Consumption and services dominate our GDP.

Consumption and services drive the Indian economy, unlike say in China, where investments and manufacturing play a key role.

---page break---

## Two ways to understand GDP

India’s GDP $3.6 trillion / ₹295.4 trillion (FY24)

### India’s GDP by expenditure components

* **PFCE (Consumption):** 56%
* **GFCF (Investment):** 33%
* **Govt. Spends:** 9%
* **Others (Exports less Imports etc ):** 2%

## Investment or Gross Fixed Capital Formation (GFCF) has been a much smaller contributor to GDP

A key reason is our middling savings rate and low FDI constricting investment in productive assets. India’s FDI inflows for FY11-20 were $512 billion while China’s for 2011-20 were over 4x that at $2.4 trillion.

### GFCF as % of GDP

* **1990-1999:** 21.8%
* **2000-2009:** 30.1%
* **2010-2019:** 36.4%
* **2020-2023:** 34.4%
* **China:**

## Services sector dominates the Indian economy

### India’s GDP by expenditure components

* **Services:** 54% of GDP, 31% of Labour Force
* **Industry:** 31% of GDP, 23% of Labour Force
* **Agriculture:** 15% of GDP, 46% of Labour Force

### Services Labour Force % Split

* **Financial & Professional Services, Real Estate (23%)**
* **Trade, Transportation, Hotels, Communication (19%)**
* **Public Services (13%)**

Services is a large contributor to India’s economy; unusual for a country with per capita income under $3k.

### Industry Labour Force % Split

* **Mining & Utilities (5%)**
* **Construction (9%)**
* **Manufacturing (17%)**

Real Estate / Construction sector is a key sector as it is a large employer of unskilled workers. It accounts for 12% of India’s labour force, more than manufacturing (11.4%)!

Manufacturing punches well below the ideal weight. China’s equivalent number is 26%. We deep dive into reason’s for manufacturing’s low share and its potential in a subsequent section.

## Services strength is visible in increasing market share of global exports (unlike Goods exports)

### India’s share of global services exports is up from 2% to nearly 5% of global trade over the past two decades

### India’s services exports has grown nearly 2x relative to peers like Brazil and Mexico

### India’s Share of Global Services and Goods Exports (in %)

* **Services:** Increasing trend from 1.9% (2005) to 4.6% (2023)
* **Goods:** Relatively stable around 1.5-1.8%

### India v Peers: Services Exports CAGR FY05-23 (in %)

* **Singapore:** 11.6%
* **Ireland:** 11.4%
* **India:** 10.9%
* **Poland:** 10.4%

## IT Exports are the crown jewel of our services economy

And of late, Professional Consulting Services and GCCs stepping up too!

### Professional Consulting has been growing faster than IT Services, though from a lower base.

### India is a global leader with 1,700 Global Capability Centres (GCCs). GCC headcount and revenue is growing faster than IT Services.

### Share of IT Services and Professional Consulting in Indian Services Exports (in %)

* **IT Services:** Decreasing trend from 40.9% (2005) to 46.6% (2023)
* **Professional Consulting:** Increasing trend from 7.0% (2005) to 18.3% (2023)

# India

## Long-Term Structural Forces

### India doesn’t save enough.

India doesn’t save enough

India’s savings is good but not great. A high savings rate is necessary given low FDI rates. A deep dive into savings illustrates that the culprit is financial savings (as opposed to physical savings), and the reason is rise in financial liabilities, chiefly led by rising (unsecured) personal loans.

---page break---

## India’s overall savings rate looks ok, but is not

Worryingly, household savings, the biggest contributor, is seeing a declining share

### India has a much lower savings rate than its Asian peers, especially China

### Household share of savings has dropped from 84% in FY00 to just 61% in FY23!

### A key reason for household savings share dropping is the drop in financial savings

### Country-wise Gross Savings as % of GDP, 2023

* **China:** 44%
* **Singapore:** 40%
* **Korea:** 34%
* **Switzerland:** 32%
* **India:** 30%
* **Germany:** 30%
* **Australia:** 24%
* **Mexico:** 23%
* **US:** 16%
* **Brazil:** 16%
* **UK:** 14%

### Savings as % of GDP by Type FY00 v FY23 (in %)

* **FY00:** Household 22.1%, Private 4.1%, Public -0.2%
* **FY23:** Household 18.4%, Private 11.2%, Public 0.6%

Household savings make up the majority of savings. They have been steadily declining (barring a pandemic-induced rise in ‘21)

### Split of Household Savings FY00 v FY23 (in %)

* **FY00:** Physical Savings 12.0%, Financial Savings 10.1%
* **FY23:** Physical Savings 13.3%, Financial Savings 5.1%

Household financial savings dropped from 10.1% to 5.% primarily as a result of financial liabilities increasing from 2 to 5.8% in the same period.

# India

## Long-Term Structural Forces

### Why land issues mean India hoards up on gold.

Why land issues mean India hoards up on gold.

India is the world’s second largest consumer of gold. Behind this are cultural factors, and economic factors, chiefly the poor land records, and the challenges in collateralising land. Gold is a far more convenient collateral as we see from these slides.

**This section was authored by Joseph Sebastian, from Blume’s Fintech team**

---page break---

## Indians have a special relationship with gold

India is the 2nd largest consumer of gold globally; and as Indians’ preferred savings instrument, gold's impact is seen across our economy

### India is the second largest consumer of gold in the world 1

### After property, gold accounts for the largest share in household assets 2

### So much so that it has material impact on our current account deficit 3

### Gold Demand by Country 2024 (in tonnes)

* **Bar and Coin**
    * **China:** 479.3
    * **India:** 563.4
* **Jewellery**
    * **China:** 336.2
    * **India:** 239.4
* **Others (Bar + Coin + Jewellery)**
    * **United States:** 132.1
    * **Turkey:** 77.8
    * **Russia:** 24.4

### Gold vs Equity: Share of Household Asset Allocation 2023 (in %)

* **Gold:** 16%
* **Equities:** 5%

By contrast, other nations typically keep just 2–3% of household wealth in gold vs India which keeps as much as 16%

### India Imports vs Exports Nov’24, and Share of Gold (in USD billion)

* **Import:** 55.2
    * **Gold Import:** 9.8
* **Export:** 32.1

Large gold imports significantly impact our Current Account Deficit (CAD), in turn influencing rupee strength and policy decisions

## Why is gold preferred? Not just because of its cultural significance but also because it is a great collateral

### In rural communities, gold is the primary way to save

* **Fixed Deposit to Gold: Where people in villages are investing and why, reveals survey**
    * **Nearly 60% of people in rural India only want to save in safe products, reveals survey**
    * **Written by FE Desk**
    * **Updated:March 25, 2023 11:09 IST**
    * **When it comes to savings, most of the people in rural India want to have their money invested in safe products only, according to a survey. Accordingly, most of them have savings in Government schemes such as PMJJBY, Saafal Jeevan, Pension Yojana, Subsidies, Farmer Insurance etc. This is followed by Gold ownership, Fixed Deposit/Recurring Deposits, Property and Public Provident Fund (PPF).**

### Trusted collateral for lenders

* **Gold Loans Surge: Boom or Burden?**
    * **Gold loan market’s rapid expansion poses more questions than answers, especially for regulator RBI**
    * **By Manoj Sharma, Nov 12, 2024 4-min read**
    * **Indian households, which own 25,000 tonnes of gold, are mortgaging it for loans in large volumes. Thanks to the thriving gold loan segment, lenders have doubled down on efforts. Fast disbursment, lower interest rates and ease in loaning gold are making the business lucrative. Most borrowers are from the lower income groups, fringe, small businesses and the unorganised sector.**

### Accessible credit for borrowers

* **Gold rush: Soaring prices drive consumers to pledge their assets**
    * **Gold holds significant place in Indian culture, often being accumulated over generations. During times of financial needs like hospital expenses and college fees, individuals are more willing to pledge their gold holdings like jewellery to secure loans.**
    * **Written by George Mathew Follow**
    * **Updated: February 2, 2023 09:57 IST**
    * **The sustained rally in gold prices has led to a significant increase in gold loans issued by banks and financial institutions, as consumers leverage the rising value of their gold assets. Gold loan outstanding jumped by 6.8 per cent, or Rs 76,000 crore to Rs 11.7 lakh crore during the nine-month period ended December 2022 from Rs 11.0 lakh crore recorded in March-end of 2022, Reserve Bank of India data shows.**

### 1 For farmers and traders, gold acted as a practical cash flow tool. They purchase gold during periods of surplus and use it as collateral for loans during times of cash requirements.

### 2 For lenders, gold-backed loans offer a significant advantage since the collateral is relatively simple to repossess if needed and It can be quickly sold in case of default.

### 3 For borrowers, no credit history is required as gold is a secure product so they can get loans very easily.

## What makes gold even more attractive in India, is that land in India is not a good source of collateral

With one of the world's smallest housing loan market and lengthy contract enforcement (1,445 days), gold emerges as the practical collateral choice because land can’t

### 1 India has one of the smallest housing loan market

### 2 One of the main reasons for that is India’s dispute resolution / contract enforcement mechanism is broken

### 3 Which makes India one of the lowest in the world in contract enforcement

### % of Respondents who had an Outstanding Mortgage in the World Bank Findex Survey vs. Country

* **India:** 5%
* **China:** 12%
* **South Korea:** 26%
* **USA:** 34%

### Average Time To Enforce a Contract (in days)

* **India:** 1,445
* **Global Average:** 358

### World in contract enforcement Ranking

* **#5 China**
* **#17 United States**
* **#58 Brazil**
* **#68 Vietnam**
* **#89 Kenya**
* **#136 India**
* **#190**

Economic growth stories in places like South Korea depended on credit creation through the mortgage industry. India's housing mortgage market is far lower than other countries because property is a more complex form of collateral compared to gold.

There are a whopping 47 million pending cases in the Indian courts. 66% of these are estimated to be linked to land as per Daksh India.

Weak contract enforcement reduces the confidence amongst lenders that property can be repossessed easily in the event default, thus making land an inefficient form of collateral

### India underinvests in human capital.

India underinvests in its human capital

Behind India’s underinvestment in human capital, is a set of complex interlinked factors but chiefly path dependence from its decision post-1947 to invest in the tertiary education sphere over the primary and secondary education sphere (unlike the Asian Tigers and China which invested in primary and secondary education over tertiary) and developed a skilled labour force.

    * "Its a government figure. Reality will be much more worse than this. Its been more than a month. We couldn't hire 4 freshers. Their expectations are to get a 30K salary. Won't do field work. Principal/Dean of a reputed college in Ahmedabad said no students of our college will apply for sales job that requires them to do field work. Unless you're not offering good corporate setups, laptops & weekends off they will not apply. No one is talking about skills. Looks like people are going to run their houses on degrees."

* **Tweet 2:** Manish R Jain (@mrjain_) - Sep 8, 2024

### Everybody wants a government job

* **Tweet 3:** Haidar Naqvi (@HaidarNaqvi_)
    * "At 2 am, Kanpur Central Station is packed with job seekers, each inch is filled with hopefuls. With over five million youths vying for just 60k positions in the UP police, it showcases the challenging job market scenario. nn"

### Why aren’t there enough government jobs?

    * **India:** 16
    * **China:** 57
    * **US:** 77

We have fewer government jobs than our peers but these are highly paid relative to the private sector. Karthik Muralidharan in his book ‘Accelerating India’s Development’ describes how government school teachers are paid 5-10 times more than private school teachers. The high pay and job security is a key reason for the high demand for government jobs and the many years invested in writing exams to break into these jobs.

## India’s demographic dividend is underway. To take advantage of it we have to focus on upskilling our workforce, and AI-proofing them!

Demographic dividend is the phase in which the proportion of working-age population (typically ages 15-64) increases rapidly compared to number of dependents (children and elderly). India’s demographic dividend phase began in 2018 and will run till 2055. Japan’s was 1964-2004 and so on.

### India v Peers, GDP growth in first 7 years of demographic dividend

* **GDP Growth Rate for First Seven Years of Demographic Dividend (in %)**
    * **China (1994-2000):** 9.9%
    * **Korea (1987-1993):** 9.4%
    * **Japan (1964-1970):** 9.3%
    * **Bangladesh (2018-2024):** 6.25%
    * **India (2018-2024):** 5.2%

Unfair but relevant comparison - India was greatly impacted by COVID led GDP decline.

### India has far fewer population that has undergone formal skills training

The above is from a 2019 Ministry of Skill Development report. It is very likely that India’s number has increased today.

**“India's reliance on services has made it a shining star in the emerging world. But AI is a howitzer aimed squarely at that prosperity. The effect AI will have on India will be profound.

## Because of land, labour and capital

### Labour

Low skill levels in the Indian labour force mean that despite lower wages, the net impact is neutral as a lower-skilled workforce is less productive.

### Land

Industrial land is expensive in India vs other similar economies. Path dependence over history led by fragmented of land parcels, unclear title rights etc., explain the higher cost of land acquisition. Below chart from a Bloomberg article by Andy Mukherjee.

### Capital

Lending rates are much higher in India vs other countries - SME loans are at low double digit whereas Chinese companies get at 4%. Multiple reasons abound, but essentially India has higher cost of capital.

### India v Peers: Share of Workforce with Formal Skills Training (in %)

# India

## Long-term Structural Forces

### How DPI made India a Digital Welfare State.

DPI has helped India become a ‘Digital Welfare State’

A good way to understand India is as a Digital Welfare State, one that leverage DPI protocols to deliver cash and in-kind benefits directly to the end users. Not all DPI protocols necessarily succeed, and we are beginning to see second-order effects of DPI policies emerge!

---page break---

## Thanks to DPI, India is now a digital welfare state

### Government has introduced a slew of DPIs…

* **Aadhar:** 1382 mn users in 2024
* **UPI:** 330 mn users in 2023
* **BHIM:** 217 mn users in 2023
* **DIGIT:** 250 mn users in 2022
* **e-Sanjeevani:** 148 mn users in 2023
* **Co-WIN:** 1190 mn users in 2023
* **ABHA:** 440 mn users in 2023
* **AA:** 25 mn users in 2023
* **ONDC:** 700k sellers, 150 mn transactions

### …driving socio-economic impact through DBTs

* **Total Direct Benefit Transfers, FY19-25 (in ₹ trillions)**
    * **FY18:** 3.2

**Aadhaar (Unique ID) + Mobile + Bank Account (Jan Dhan Account) has enabled direct benefit transfers and reduced leakages in the system.**

**“Today, in just 30 seconds, I can directly transfer money into the accounts of 100 million farmers. Today, I can send subsidy to 130 million gas cylinder consumers with just one click, in 30 seconds. Billions that were being siphoned out due to corruption are now saved.” - PM Narendra Modi**

## As UPI hits maturity, we are seeing its second order effects

### UPI winning market share from debit and credit cards

* **Market Share by Volume of Transactions across Payment Methods (%)**
    * **UPI (P2M):** Increasing trend from 8% (FY17) to 87% (FY23)
    * **Debit Cards:** Decreasing trend from 69% (FY17) to 7% (FY23)
    * **Credit Cards:** Decreasing trend from 29% (FY17) to 6% (FY23)

UPI processed 172 billion transactions worth over ₹ 245 tn ($~3tn) in 2024. It accounted for 83% of all digital transactions in 2024, compared to just 34% five years ago.

### …and is beginning to impact demand for cash amongst the upper income tier…

* **Dec 2024:** 633.4 Mn

### …but 0% MDR taking out profit pools for Payment Service Providers

#### Highest profit pool in payments lies with NPCI: PhonePe CEO Sameer Nigam

* **NPCI was established under the aegis of RBI as a non-profit to run a few payment systems such as Immediate Payment Service (IMPS), Unified Payments Interface (UPI), and Bharat Bill Payment System (BBPS). In FY22, NPCI posted a Rs 73 crore profit.**

#### Potential Revenue Pool from 0.5% MDR on Non-P2P Transactions

* **$4.1 Bn**

#### Revenue Forgone by Indian PSPs (Assuming 0.5% Debit Card MDR)

NPCI, in March 2023, introduced an interchange fee of 1.1% on P2M transactions >Rs.2000 made via prepaid instruments like a mobile wallet or prepaid card. While this is a small portion of the revenue pool, it could signal the introduction of MDRs for other transaction types.

Consumption

India’s consumption numbers look good on an overall basis, but not on a per capita basis. We take a look at why this is so. We look at how India1, India’s top 10%, drives the Indian economic engine, and find that India1 is not widening as much as deepening. Finally, we show how India1’s high share of consumption shapes the India consumer market in many distinct ways.

## Consumption is the dominant driver of India’s GDP

It has consistently been above 55% since ‘00; Investment / GFCF plays a far lesser role unlike in China

### PFCE and GFCF as % of India GDP (at current prices)

* **Line chart showing PFCE and GFCF % from FY00 to FY24. PFCE consistently higher than GFCF.** (Detailed line chart data not easily represented textually)
* **PFCE** around 60%, **GFCF** around 30%

### How we stack up vis-a-vis China

GFCF is essentially creation of productive assets such as machinery, infrastructure. Unlike India, investment (GFCF) plays a larger role in China’s GDP at 41% vs. India’s 31%.

### China GDP Breakup 2023

* **PFCE:** 39%
* **GFCF:** 41%
* **Govt. Spends:** 17%
* **Exports:** 20%
* **Imports:** -18%
* **Others:** 1%

**Note: PFCE at 60.3% differs from PFCE of 56% on Slide #24; 60.3% is at current prices, while 56% was at constant prices (2011-12). It is hard to get long time-series data for constant prices.**

Why does India consume so little? Why are penetration rates so low across so many categories?

* **Description:** India1 is the consuming class, and effectively constitutes the market for most startups. Also most startups start here and then expand to India2.

### India 2 ‘Indonesia’*

* **The Aspirant Class:** ~70m households, ~300m people, ~$3k per person
* **Description:** India2 is the emerging aspirant class. They are heavy consumers and reluctant payers. OTT / media, gaming, edtech and lending are relevant markets for them. UPI and AutoPay has unlocked small ticket spends and transactions from this group.

### India 3 ‘Sub-Saharan Africa’

* **Unmonetisable Users (& Non-Users):** ~205Mn households, ~1Bn people, ~$1k per person
* **Description:** India3 doesn’t have the kind of incomes to be able to spend anything on discretionary goods. They are beyond the pale, as of now, for startups.

**Some apps straddle different Indias e.g., Whatsapp, Youtube, Flipkart etc. A good way to understand the above is that all apps in India3 can be used by India2 and India1. Similarly India2 apps can be used by India1. The reverse isn’t true. India1 apps are not used by India2 or India3.**

**\* Indonesia’s per capita income is $5k; strictly this is not the right country analogy for India2, but we couldn’t get a country that has a population of ~300m with a per capita income of $3k. So please bear with us for this.**

**With US$ 15K per capita income, India1 would pass the World Bank’s $14K threshold for “high income” status.**

**India1 is spread across urban and rural areas, not concentrated in specific regions (though there is less in East India). Given the dispersion, and the overall size of 10% of population, it has less direct political influence. Its influence is manifested in its consumption behaviour and social media voice, as well as how it helps India project soft power abroad. In the coming years, it will get richer, and the economic gap between it and India will widen. This will bring distinct challenges that we as a society will need to work together to overcome.**

# Indus Valley in one tweet

[Tweet about Uber Auto and Namma Yatri]

Uber was forced to make a change to its traditional revenue model (commission on the fare paid) for (3-wheeler) autos in India.

Namma Yatri, an Indian startup leveraged the open source Beckn protocol (part of India Stack / Digital Public Infra ) to build a mobility solution where the revenue model was to charge a daily (or monthly) fee for drivers for the app, and not take a slice of the fare paid. The success of this model has forced all the other mobility players (Rapido, Ola, and now Uber to follow suit).

The tweet shows how first-world revenue models have to adapt to the unique needs of the Indian market, the rise of DPI, and DPI-native revenue models.

## Seed funding continues on trendlines - fewer rounds, larger checks

Larger seed rounds or ‘mango seeds’ (>$3M) now make up 50% of funding, while <$1M rounds drop to one third of 2017 levels. This is led by second time founders, and elite operators, raising larger formation cheques.

### Seed funding split by stages per year

* **Stacked bar chart showing <$1 Mn Rounds, $1-3 Mn Rounds, and >$3 Mn Rounds from 2017 to 2024.** (Detailed bar chart data not easily represented textually)

In 2021, about 2,513 raised a seed round while in 2024 only 1,078 raised. The biggest drop was in the <$1 mn segment (37% down). $1-3m saw a 22% drop.**

## The Early-Stage funding gap is fueling the rise of MicroVCs

Between angels and choosy seed funds, a new stage (pre-seed), and backer (the MicroVC), is emerging

### MicroVCs have created their niche in early Seed stage

### Rise of Specialised MicroVCs

#### What has led to the rise of MicroVCs?

As Seed / Multistage funds get choosy and prefer to focus on elite founders, a gap is opening up in funding for first-time founders, which is being filled by MicroVCs.

#### How are MicroVCs different?

- ➔ Have a special focus or highly evolved thesis in a particular domain
- ➔ There are over 100 MicroVCs (many founded recently) typically investing $100k-$500k at seed / pre-seed stage. These funds invest at valuations of $1M-$8M, taking 3-8% stakes in startups, sometimes more.

#### Specialised MicroVC Categories with Example Funds:

* **Saas / DevTools:**  z21 ventures, EOLD CAP, FOSTR VENTURES, upeklena, Ahead VC, NEON, Grayscale Ventures
* **Deeptech / Life Sciences:**  SPECIALE INVEST, Golden Sparrow, ideaspring capital, W HEALTH VENTURES

## Venture Debt becomes more common as equity funding tightens up

Longer fundraising cycles and tighter equity markets are making startups tap into venture debt

### Venture Debt has picked up sharply over the last 7 years

### Venture Debt has grown from <1% of venture funding to 11%

### Venture Debt Market in India (in USD billion)

* **Increasing trend from 2017 ($0.06 Bn) to 2023 ($1.2 Bn)** (Detailed bar chart data not easily represented textually)

### Share of Venture Debt in Total Venture Funding (in %)

* **Increasing trend from 0.5% (2017) to 11.0% (2023)** (Detailed line chart data not easily represented textually)

### Implication of raising Venture Debt:

- ➔ Higher Liquidation Preference: Venture debt typically comes with priority claims on company assets and cash flows, over equity holders
- ➔ Equity-Dependent Credit Lines: Available venture debt limits are often tied to equity reserves, creating potential downward spirals if equity positions weaken
- ➔ Risk of Negative Cycle: As equity funding becomes harder to secure, venture debt capacity may shrink exactly when companies need it most.

## Guideline for founders mulling over an SME IPO

### What needs to be kept in mind for the SME IPO?

#### A long-Term lens

Public markets are a marathon, not a sprint; you need to have a decade-long time horizon when you think about going public.

#### Predictability

What public markets expect is predictability; they don't want any surprises, so your business has to have stability and you should have clear revenue foresight.

#### Why wait for a billion-Dollar IPO?

You can continue to compound in public markets - if you grow 20-25%, public markets would value you more than private markets.

#### Clarity on ‘use of funds’

In private markets, it's fine if the capital you raise isn't used exactly as stated, but in public markets, you need to be very precise about how the capital will be used since this will be audited

### What is the eligibility criteria?

#### Common criteria for NSE Emerge & BSE SME

- ➔ 3+ years existence
- ➔ Max post-issue paid-up capital: ₹25 Mn
- ➔ Positive EBITDA: 2 out of last 3 FYs

#### Exchange-specific criteria

- ➔ NSE Emerge: Requires positive net worth & FCF to equity
- ➔ BSE SME: Minimum net worth ₹10 Mn & net tangible assets ₹30 Mn

### Unit economics of a single Blinkit order

### Metrics FY25E

* **GOV:** ₹27,867 Cr
* **% yoy:** 123.50%
* **Average MTUs:** 9.6 Mn
* **AOV:** ₹674
* **Orders:** 413 Mn
* **Implied Take Rates:** 19.50%
* **Adjusted Revenue:** ₹5,420 Cr
* **Contribution Margin (as % of GOV):** 4.00%
* **Adjusted EBITDA:** (₹33 Cr)
* **% margin on GOV:** (0.10%)

### Unit economics breakdown

* **Sources for ₹131 revenue:**
    * **Blinkit Revenue 19.5% (₹131)**
        * **Commission & Ad Revenue:** ₹120
        * **User Fee:** ₹11

    * **Other Variable Costs:** ₹61
    * **Delivery Costs:** ₹35
    * **Discounts:** ₹5
    * **Contribution Profit:** ₹31

**In contrast, Swiggy was AOV of 515 and 15.5% take rate (Rs.80) which makes it difficult for them to cover delivery & other variable costs and hence lose money. Ultimately variable costs are also a function of scale (with increased orders, per unit costs drop!)**

## The urban consumer is shifting their buying behaviour away from Kirana stores

### 1 Visible impact on Kirana stores

### 2 Urban shoppers prefer Quick Commerce

### 3 Kirana owners are clearly worried

### Kirana Stores’ Share of Gross Value Added of Trade Sector (in %)

* **2015-16:** 34%
* **2023-24:** 22%

### Share of Kirana Stores in Total Unincorporated Enterprises (in %)

* **2015:** ₹16 L
* **2020:** ₹9 L
* **2024:** ₹3 L

### Share of Walk-in sales vs Home delivery (in %)

* **2015:** Walk-ins 90%, Home delivery 10%
* **2024:** Walk-ins 50%, Home delivery 50% (Incorrect Pie Chart - should be Walk-ins 50%, Home delivery 50%)

### 1 Trade promotions by FMCG players are absent.

Previously, retailers could earn major incentives like washing machines for meeting targets - these volume-based rewards are now rare.

### 2 Margins on branded products have dropped significantly.

For instance, biscuit category margins have fallen from 22% to 7-8%, severely impacting retailer profits.

### 3 Weakened demand has forced retailers to abandon bulk purchasing in favor of smaller, frequent orders.

This shift further reduces margins as they lose bulk buying benefits.

**Kirana stores don’t have enough options (SKUs) for brand conscious customers. And with free delivery as well as the discounts that QCom offers, online works out cheaper.**

## Irrational exuberance about Quick Commerce?

A slew of analyst reports have projected heady numbers for Quick Commerce; for instance an equity research report from a leading brokerage house projects the Industry to hit $89b in FY31 (FY25E of $7.1bn). How realistic is this?

### Orders per month per user

### Gross annual order value

### Monthly transacting users (MTUs)

### Number of dark stores

### Total annual orders

### FY25E vs FY31E data points for each metric:

* **Orders per month / user:** FY25E ~3.5, FY31E ~6
* **GOV:** FY25E ~$7 Bn, FY31E ~$89 Bn
* **MTUs:** FY25E ~26 Mn, FY31E ~128 Mn
* **Dark Stores:** FY25E ~3,400, FY31E ~11,150
* **Total Orders:** FY25E ~1.1 Bn, FY31E ~9.3 Bn

**Let us examine two of these above estimates: Monthly transacting users (MTUs), as well as Dark Stores, closely.**

---page break---

## How realistic is the Monthly Transacting User number?

Growth projections to 128 million monthly transacting users (MTUs) look ambitious when India1 itself is not widening fast

### How Quick Commerce is projected to grow

* **Bar chart showing FY25E vs FY31E MTUs and Orders/month.** (Detailed bar chart data not easily represented textually)
* **MTUs projected to increase significantly, Orders/month increase slightly.**

### This misses out on the true upper bound of the Indian consuming class

* **Tweet from Kunal Shah highlighting that India1 consumption is led by a smaller subset of super consumers.** (Tweet not easily represented textually)

**Much of India’s consumption is led by India1, and within that there is a subset we call India1 Alpha, which is about 8-10 million households large who are true super consumers. This class is growing slowly, and as we saw in the Consumption section, has deepened than widened. The growth in MTUs will thus attract marginal users not power users, and thus orders nearly doubling will be challenging.**

## We have been here before

July 2021 estimates by Jefferies projected 32.6M users for Zomato by FY25, but current trajectory points to 20.6M users in FY25 - a reminder about user growth forecasts in consumer internet consistently fall short

### Jefferies estimate of Zomato’s Monthly Transacting Users (MTUs) in Jul’21

### In reality, Zomato has not come anywhere near those projections. It is at 2/3rd of those numbers.

### Estimates of Zomato MTU Numbers (in millions)

* **FY22E:** 10.9 Mn
* **FY23E:** 16.9 Mn
* **FY24E:** 23.6 Mn
* **FY25E:** 32.6 Mn
* **FY26E:** 44.3 Mn

### Actual Zomato MTU Numbers (in millions)

* **FY22:** 14.7 Mn
* **FY23:** 17.1 Mn
* **FY24:** 18.4 Mn
* **FY25E:** 20.6 Mn

## How realistic is the Dark Stores number?

### But does India have so much depth?

### The dark store number is projected to grow from 3400 to 11500 over 6 years

### When existing dark stores have begun stagnating

### Dark Stores

* **FY25E:** 3,400
* **FY31E:** 11,150

### Orders Per Darkstore Per Day

* **Q1FY23:** 600
* **Q3FY23:** 950
* **Q1FY24:** 1050
* **Q3FY24:** 1350
* **Q1FY25:** 1350

**A proxy for affluence is presence of 5+ organised retail stores, which per a Bernstein study is seen in only 5% of India’s pincodes. These pincodes serves 11% of population.**

**The challenge is that there are not many of these in a country with per capita income below $3k.**

**Presuming each of Blinkit, Instamart, Zepto has 2 Dark Stores per pincode, and rounding off to 10 Dark Stores per pincode, we are still looking at 9,650 Dark Stores (not 11,500).**

**Per a HDFC Securities study, there are only 63 districts in India (<10% of 780 or so districts) with per capita income of ₹150k+ and density > 500 people per sq km. These have ~90m households in all (across all income levels) and per HDFC Securities, these can support at max ~7,800 dark stores, not 11,500!**

**Added to that is that Orders per Dark Store have stabilised. Given this, and the diminishing returns of expanding Dark Stores beyond certain areas, the aggressive projections of total orders seem a tad unrealistic. (80% of Blinkit’s sales come from the top 8 cities per Albinder (3QFY25 analyst call transcript).**

---page break---

## TL;DR

- ● Quick Commerce is not immune to the gravitational pull of low TAM (given India’s low per capita income) and the power law of a tiny percentage of superconsumers
- ● Like rideshare, food delivery, and even ecommerce, we will see MTU growth tapering - it is unlikely that Quick Commerce is immune to this.
- ● ECommerce players have already started reacting, and while it is not guaranteed they will be able to counter Quick Commerce players, the increased competition will have some impact on the Quick Commerce industry profit pool.
- ● It is the case that we are moving to almost every ecommerce platform speeding up their delivery. India will become a Quickish Commerce country, especially because of the superconsumers are in high density areas amenable to rapid delivery.
- ● As Quick Commerce expands, and the toll on Kiranas becomes more visible, we may see more visible debates and measures to check Quick Commerce’s growth.

## Why didn’t India do DeepSeek?

### The forcing functions that created DeepSeek

### 1 China being the base for 1/8th of World’s top AI researchers (India has none)

### 2 China has been continuously investing in and improving in AI. The Australian Strategic Policy Institute identified that China led in just three of 64 critical technologies in the years from 2003 to 2007, but is the leading country in 57 of 64 technologies over the past five years from 2019 to 2023.

### 3 Constraints breed creativity - the challenges in accessing GPUs led them to approaches and tech minimising GPU use

### 4 Crackdown on the finance industry leading to the hedge fund High-Flyer deciding to redirect its attention towards AI tech, away from Finance. They also managed to access capital (Govt support?) to undertake the $1.6b+ investment to develop the same ($1.6b via Semi Analysis)

## How Kaleidofin reengineered the credit rating product for India2 / India3

### ki score is an inclusive supervised AI/ML score developed by Kaleidofin, and used for Credit Decisioning and Risk Management through all stages of the loan lifecycle. It is designed to reduce risk while significantly increasing access to traditionally underserved customers. It is built on datasets with dimensions including credit history, demographics, customer behaviour and alternate data. It is a powerful tool for increasing access to appropriate credit beyond a credit bureau score.”

### ki score has increased loans disbursed by 73%

### PAR 90% data validates ki score's accuracy and inclusiveness

### Monthly household income growth for nano-entrepreneurs shows ki score’s impact

### Cumulative Number of Loans Enabled by ki score for a Representative Partner, Sep 2021-24 (in unit thousands)

* **Stacked bar chart showing ki score Accept & Credit Bureau Rejected, ki score & Credit Bureau Accepted, and ki score Rejected & Credit Bureau Accepted.** (Detailed bar chart data not easily represented textually)
* **Sep-21:** ki score enabled 2.1, additional loans beyond traditional credit bureau ratings 0.8
* **Sep-24:** ki score enabled 223.7, additional loans beyond traditional credit bureau ratings 40.8

### PAR 90% measures borrowers defaulting on principal for over 90 days. Customers approved by ki score but rejected by credit bureaus have lower default rates compared to those rejected by ki score but approved by credit bureaus (cb hereafter).

### Category wise PAR 90%

* **ki score accept + cb accept:** 1.53%
* **ki score accept + cb reject:** 2.51%
* **ki score reject + cb accept:** 4.44%
* **ki score reject + cb reject:** 7.68%

### Monthly Household Income (in INR thousands)

* **Baseline Average:** ₹38k
* **Endline Average:** ₹45k
* **% Increase:** 47k

**Findings from a pool of ki scored nano-entrepreneurs shows the impact that access to timely credit may have on customer resilience and well-being and the ki score acts as a key enabler here. “We see an average increase of 26% in monthly HH income, 47% in annual business turnover, and 52% in monthly business profits.”**

## Emerging Playbook: Rethink the product for the specific job to be done (JTBD) to fit India2’s context

Here, founders understand the core Job-To-Be-Done (JTBD) in the context of the India2 user, including how prevalent cultural practices will support adoption, and use this to rethink the product itself.

### India 1

* **Brand Logos: bumble, Hinge**
* **JTBD: Help me start dating**

### India 2

* **Brand Logos: frnd**
* **JTBD: Before I can think of dating, I need to speak to members of the opposite sex. So the product is to enable better conversations, via gamified formats.**

### India 2

* **Brand Logos: wysa, Rocket Health**
* **JTBD: I need easy, reliable access to high quality mental healthcare.**

### India 2

* **Brand Logos: Astrotalk**
* **JTBD: I don’t think there is anything wrong with me that I need ‘therapy’ (it is not socially acceptable in my context). Astrology counselling is a safe socially acceptable space for me to unburden myself and get some emotional relief.**

---page break---

## Two other core features of the Emerging India2 Playbook: Voice and microtransactions

which enables 1:1 counselling conversations, is an example of a company that exemplifies these features.

### Heavy on voice, with 1:1 conversations as a key revenue driver

### Microtransactions-led revenue model (prefilled wallet used for gifting) leading to whale + tail model

### Monthly minutes consumed by users

* **Feb 2023:** 0.04 Mn
* **Feb 2024:** 0.42 Mn
* **Jan 2025:** 2.50 Mn

### Share of Payers vs Share of Revenue

* **Share of Payers:** 1%
* **Share of Revenue:** 48%
* **Share of Payers:** 9%
* **Share of Revenue:** 30%
* **Share of Payers:** 22%
* **Share of Revenue:** 96%

**FRND, AstroTalk, InstaAstro, Clarity all have 1:1 voice as a key revenue model. India2 (and many India1) users are willing to pay to talk to a stranger (expert or member of the opposite sex). The success of this model is attracting apps with a tangential interest in the space (e.g., Lokal) to explore this revenue opportunity.**

## How Indus Valley influenced Indian advertising.

How Indus Valley influenced Indian advertising.

How Indus Valley rethought the celebrity ad to generate shock value, and how it has shaped the Indian advertising market. We also look at the currency of trust-building is diverging between India1 and India2 resulting in distinct communication templates.

---page break---

## How Indus Valley pioneered a new ad trope

Humanising celebrities, making fun of them, was a new addition to the Indian ad oeuvre. Legacy brands historically kept the celebrity on a near pedestal (with some exceptions).

* **Images of CRED Ads with Rahul Dravid, Anil Kapoor, Madhuri Dixit Nene, and LensKart Ads with Karan Johar and Peyush Bansal.** (Images not easily represented textually)

- ➔ What is common to these ads is that their makers are ex-members of AIB (All India Bakchod) a comedy collective that melted down in the 2018 #metoo wave. Key members include Tanmay Bhatt, Devaiah Bopanna, Vishal Dayama etc. **[Tanmay + Deviah also work together as Moonshot.]**

- ➔ They pitched legacy brands who hesitated to sign them given their lack of big agency experience; Startups however found a perfect match in them especially given the comedians’ ability to create attention and shock value by depicting celebrities in a never before light, cutting through clutter.

**This and the following slides in this section benefited significantly from inputs gathered during a conversation with Karthik Srinivasan, a leading ad / marketing guru (x.com/beastoftraal). I also enjoyed speaking with Arun Iyer (x.com/aruniyer), a seasoned adman who co-founded and is Partner at Spring Marketing Capital.**

---page break---

## As the ‘ComAdians’ went up market, Big Ad stepped down to partner with startups

* **Images of Moonshot and Daftar advertising agencies websites and work examples.** (Images not easily represented textually)

**Moonshot now works with the likes of Vadilal, Rungta Steel etc. Daftar, a smaller creative shop does work for Pepsi… Meanwhile a couple of glimpses of how mainstream ad agencies are working with scaling startups.**

---page break---

## Meanwhile, Indus Valley likes full stack brand-building

### Founders are building personal brands to canvass for their startups, or sometimes just to build personal brands.

### Zomato inspired the trend of startups setting up agencies. That trend has continued to gather strength.

* **News Snippets about more and more new-age firms setting up in-house creative teams.** (News Snippets not easily represented textually)

## The currency of trust-building is also diverging between India1 and India2

How trust is mediated through communication is diverging between India1 and India2.

* **Images of India1 product (Minimalist Serum) and India2 product (RummyCircle Ad).** (Images not easily represented textually)

**Highlighting ingredients, clever copy, and use of content are ways to build trust for India1 products. In the case of India2, trust is mediated through the credibility associated with a celebrity. While celebs are also used for India1 advertising, they are used more to cut through clutter (e.g., Bold Care, Cred) and less to reinforce or borrow credibility from.**

## Returns, and how Indian startups are addressing it.

Returns, and how Indian startups are addressing it.

Indian startups in the consumer space, especially apparel and footwear brands, have a returns issue. We analyse trends and suggest playbooks that Brands are adopting / can adopt to overcome these challenges.

---page break---

## High Return rates are a key concern area for Indian online sellers

### Around a sixth of ecommerce shipment volumes get returned

### Returns can be even higher on marketplaces

### Returns are higher for Cash-on-Delivery orders

### Returns are highest for fashion & footwear

### For COD orders of fashion brands on marketplaces, returns are thus in the 45-55% range!

### B2C Shipments & Reverse Shipments

* **Bar chart showing B2C Shipments and Reverse Shipments from FY20 to FY24.** (Detailed bar chart data not easily represented textually)
* **FY24:** B2C Shipments ~4,400 Mn, Reverse Shipments ~720 Mn (16%)

**Source: Redseer x Ecom Express Report, Unicommerce India Ecommerce Index 2023 Report, Return Prime Report**

---page break---

## Understanding Returns

### Two types of Returns

#### Return to Origin (RTO)

Customer not at home or order not delivered

#### Return to Vendor (RTV)

Customer collects and returns due to wrong item, damages, or fit issues

### How returns stack up for a fashion brand*

* **Table showing Return Rates for Own Website vs Marketplaces**
    * **RTO:** Own Website 10%, Marketplaces 9%
    * **RTV:** Own Website 14%, Marketplaces 39%
    * **Total Returns:** Own Website 24%, Marketplaces 48%

**A high return rate increases logistics cost, leads to more spoilage due to the back-and-forth thereby increasing cost of goods sold. In the process of collection, repair, and clean up it also reduces the inventory available for sale. Returns thereby have a corrosive impact on unit economics.**

**Marketplaces encourage returns (to reduce purchase friction), and customer is frequently encouraged to bracket, i.e., buying multiple sizes and then returning several back.**

**Note: * The fashion brand wants to remain unnamed**

---page break---

## Reducing RTO or Return to Origin

Ajith Pai, COO, Delhivery: “There are two factors that determine the extent of RTO 1/ Speed of fulfillment : faster the delivery, the lower the likelihood of doorstep rejections 2/ COD vs Prepaid: the higher the Prepaid share of orders, the lower the RTO.”

### Successfully increased speed of delivery

### COD vs Prepaid

### Speed of Fulfillment

* **Average days taken for eCommerce Delivery 2016-23**
    * **Line chart showing decreasing trend of Average days taken for eCommerce Delivery from 2016 to 2023.** (Detailed line chart data not easily represented textually)
    * **2016:** ~8.0 days
    * **2023:** ~2.8 days

### Cash-on-Delivery Share of Total Shipments 2022 v 2024 (in %)

* **2022:** 67%
* **2024:** 65%

**This has been trickier. Regular customers do graduate from COD to Prepaid, but as ecommerce expands to Tier 3 towns / India2, there is a rise in customers who prefer COD. So overall COD has only slightly moved down to 65%.**

### Return-to-Origin Rates Split by Payment Type 2022 v 2024

* **Overall RTO:** 2022 17.3%, 2024 17.8%
* **Cash-on-Delivery RTO:** 2022 23.9%, 2024 23.2%
* **Prepaid RTO:** 2022 3.9%, 2024 3.5%

**35% of this COD is UPI at doorstep. This is higher than Delhivery’s peers (at 5-10%), and is largely a function of their focus in bringing down cash handling.**

**2024’s avg shipment value of COD is ₹660 and prepaid is ₹1,850. Clearly richer customers pay in advance. Prepaid shipment value has increased over the years, but COD shipment value is stable.**

**RTOs drop sharply with prepaid orders! COD order RTOs are 6x more likely than Prepaid order RTOs!**

**Source: Redseer x Unicommerce Report, Delhivery**

---page break---

## Consumer Brands (and marketplaces) are nudging buyers to prepay

Introducing friction, creating commitments for COD are ways to nudge customers slowly into prepaid orders

### 1 Levying a ‘handling fee’

### 2 Making customers pay a small advance

### 3 Nudging customers to pay in advance by charging more for COD

* **App screenshots showing examples of levying handling fee, offering discounts for prepaid, and nudging customers to pay in advance.** (App screenshots not easily represented textually)

---page break---

## D2C / Consumer Brands beginning to see the impact of these nudges

an eCommerce enabler brand providing smart checkout and COD-enabler solutions shared data on how COD is trending downwards for the brands they support.

### COD orders trending down

### Tier 1 Cities COD Orders %

* **2022:** 54%
* **2023:** 46%
* **2024:** 41%

### Tier 2 Cities COD Orders %

* **2022:** 63%
* **2023:** 57%
* **2024:** 52%

### Tier 3 Cities COD Orders %

* **2022:** 66%
* **2023:** 61%
* **2024:** 56%

**Remember this was 65% for Delhivery!**

**As we see here, the higher the city tier, the lower the COD share of orders!**

**An interesting data point shared by GoKwik team was on the rise of Credit as a payment option at checkout. From <1% in ‘22 it is at ~5.5% in ‘24.**
